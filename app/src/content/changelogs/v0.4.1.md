## Added

### Options
The options menu can be used to configure Argon to your liking. No longer will you be plagued by porn jumpscares.
- Blur NSFW: Blurs NSFW posts so you aren't jumpscared by porn
- Blur Suggestive: No big booby women in *my* Christian household
- Blur Untagged: Blurs untagged posts if you wanna be super safe
- Sort: Changes how posts are sorted

### Unsafe Tags
When adding a tag, now you can put '!' at the start to mark it as unsafe. This will cause the post to be treated as if it were NSFW.

### Autocomplete clicking
Now you can click on autocomplete suggestion in order to add it to your search. Before, only arrow keys and enter could be used to interact with the autocomplete.

### Search clearing
Clicking on the "logo" (if you can call it that) now refreshes the page, which will clear the search and bring you back to the main page

## Fixed
- Fixed inputting exclusion tags when searching not working (putting '!' at the start of a tag when searching will exclude posts with that tag)
- Fixed tags resetting when changing page
