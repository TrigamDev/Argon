## Added
### Tags List
Added a tags list page. Here, every tag is listed, sorted by their types and usage count. This is to be used as a reference for what tags are currently used for when you're tagging a post.

### Bookmarking
You can now press a button while on a post's page to bookmark it! This saves it into your bookmarks, which can be viewed by pressing the bookmark button on the home page.

## Fixed
- Tags are, like, actually sorted a bit now
- Tag inputs finally fix capitalization so you don't gotta worry about it
