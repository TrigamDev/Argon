# Tags
Tags are short descriptors used in order to describe a post. Posts are typically tagged with multiple tags to build up a description of the post that enables it to be searched for. For example, a post may be tagged with `trigam_(artist)`, `amber_(character)`, etc.

Tags have specific formatting so they're able to be parsed, and may not work when not formatted correctly. Tags have a name and type, with the formatting as follows: `<name>_(<type>)`. So, for `spurhuns_(artist)`, the name would be `spurhuns` and the type would be `artist`.

Other important formatting guidelines:
- Tags should always be completely lowercase, with no uppercase letters. This is mostly just for aesthetics rather than function.
  - (`home-con_(character)` instead of `Home-Con_(Character)`)
- Tags should have no spaces whatsoever, as tags are seperated by spaces. Spaces should instead be replaced with underscores (`_`).
  - (`spook_lass_(artist)` instead of `spook lass_(artist)`)
