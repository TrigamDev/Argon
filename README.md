# Argon
Argon is a private archival and viewing app for art. The goal is to make it easy to save art and then find and view it later on. This app came about due to art being difficult to find, save, organize, and some art being lost to time.

Argon is private due to the fact it's solely meant for those close to me, though anyone can host their own instance of it if they wish.
